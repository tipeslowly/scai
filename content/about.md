*From the Rainbow Screen* is the first in a series of collaborative online projects developed by the Hong Kong University Libraries and HKU scholars. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire), the Getty's open-source publishing environment.

This collaboration was inspired by Professor Soren Edgren's intensive course on the *History of the Book in China*, which he taught at HKU in 2017, as part of a series of preservation-based lectures and workshops. Primary text for this publication has been excerpted from HKU Professor Yang Yuanzheng's manuscript on Confucian music and rites.

Further information on the Fung Ping Shan Library and the Jiayetang Collection is taken from HKUL's 2018 exhibition *Paper and Ink: Ming and Qing Dynasty Manuscripts from the Jiayetang Collection*.

The project collaborators gratefully acknowledge a 2019-2020 Knowledge Exchange grant from The University of Hong Kong.
