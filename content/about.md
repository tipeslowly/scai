*From the Rainbow Screen* is the first in a series of collaborative online projects developed by the Hong Kong University Libraries and HKU scholars. The publication was designed using [Quire](https://gettypubs.github.io/quire), the Getty's open-source publishing environment for creating traditional and digitally enhanced books.

Primary text for this publication has been excerpted from HKU Professor Yang Yuanzheng's developing mansucript on Confucian music and rites.

Further information on the Fung Ping Shan Library and the Jiayetang Collection was taken from HKUL's 2018 exhibition *Paper and Ink: Ming and Qing Dynasty Manuscripts from the Jiayetang Collection*.

The authors gratefully acknowledge a 2019-2020 Knowledge Exchange grant from The University of Hong Kong.
