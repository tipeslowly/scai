A series of senior ministers of the Lu family worked for the Emperor Kangxi, though Lu Xuan’s pathway into the civil bureaucracy was far from smooth. After passing the initial xiucai examinations in his late teens, he was unsuccessful in the following juren examinations. At this point, he chose to abandon his aspirations to sit the imperial exams, and instead decided to live in a retreat on Xu Mountain, near present-day Wuxi. Taking inspiration from the Jin dynasty poet Tao Yuanming, who was born in Chaisang, and the Tang dynasty’s Wang Wei, who lived in seclusion at Lantian, Lu Xuan planted numerous plum trees around his isolated residence, and so took for himself the hao soubriquet “Mei Gu,” meaning “plum valley.” There he assembled a large collection of old books. As well as his editorial work, he was a connoisseur of paintings and calligraphy; two of his particular areas of expertise were book-binding and scroll mounting.\n Lu Xuan's Meanings in the Book of Documents, handwritten by Shen Cai   fullscreen   Lu Xuan's Meanings in the Book of Documents, handwritten by Shen Cai    Lu’s preface to Meanings in the Book of Documents records that the book was finished in the first lunar month of 1786, and that the copying began in 1787, taking about one year to complete. Despite the amount of work involved, the book was never published beyond the manuscript copy. As its starting point, the work takes the “New Text” format of the Book of Documents, and so is divided into the fifty-eight chapters of that tradition, while in terms of exegesis, Lu Xuan’s preference was for the older styles of the Han dynasty onwards, rather than the neo-Confucian Song dynasty school of Zhu Xi, as is exemplified by his pupil Shen Cai’s seminal commentary.\nIn 1916, upon reading Meanings in the Book of Documents, the distinguished literatus Ye Changzhi (1849–1917) remarked:\n In terms of the scholarship of Confucian canonical texts, it has no particular scholarly lineage and is not worth discussing; however, the book’s contents have been written out by the concubine Shen Hongping in a petite kai script, and quite neatly and elegantly. Judging from whoever bound the book, and also considering its small seal, these are clearly the work of a woman and not a man, and as an example of an oft-repeated tale amongst the literati, it is a precious deposit of the innermost treasury; so, I advised Hanyi [one of Liu Chenggan’s soubriquets] to add it to his collection.” Miao Quansun echoed these views, and his bibliographical entry for Liu Chenggan’s catalogue includes the phrase: “In its copying, fine and fastidious, and most delightful, certainly worthy of preservation.”\n ","id":1,"length":469,"title":"1.

Courtesy of Shanghai Library.    Shen Cai, zi soubriquet Hongping (c. 1748–?; translated as “Rainbow Screen”), was the daughter of a gentry family of Pinghu in Zhejiang. When her family fell upon hard times, she became a maid for the Peng household in Haiyan, descendants of the poet-scholar-official Peng Sunyu (1631–1700). Later she became the personal servant of his granddaughter Peng Zhenyin. After Peng Zhenyin married Lu Xuan, Shen Cai moved into the new household along with her mistress, at which time she was thirteen years old. She subsequently became Lu Xuan’s concubine and was entrusted with the task of organizing his collection of books, paintings, and calligraphy.\nLu Xuan’s collected works were published towards the end of Qianlong’s reign as The Plum Valley: Ten Books and Shen Cai’s writing as the Spring Rain Cottage Collection; in both cases, her handwriting was used by the woodblock cutting craftsmen as the model, as can be seen immediately in comparison with the calligraphy in Meanings in the Book of Documents.\nThe complete manuscript consists of twelve volumes. Originally bound in blue silk, all but two had mottled paper wrappings whose patterns resemble tiger-skins placed over the silk; only one of these two retains its original blue silk wrapping, while the other has the silk only on one side. The stitching along the binding edge of each volume has six holes—more than the usual four, which indicates the degree of care taken with the overall presentation. Yellow silk slips would have been placed over the binding corners to protect the edges, but they were likely removed when the manuscript was restored. The front cover of each volume has a strip of gold paper stuck to its left edge that records the book’s title and list of chapters.\nAt the end of each juan, Lu Xuan’s name is recorded as the author, and Shen Cai’s as the copyist, together with their respective seals.\n Seals of the author Lu Xuan and amanuensis Shen Cai. Her sobriquet Rainbow Screen are the two small seals in the fourth column from the left.   fullscreen   Seals of the author Lu Xuan and amanuensis Shen Cai. Her sobriquet Rainbow Screen are the two small seals in the fourth column from the left.    The wording of the seals employed by Shen Cai varies; for example, “Xu Shan Can Qie” (“Silkworm Cultivating Concubine of Xu Mountain”); “Mei Gu Shi Shi” (“Plum Valley Clerk”); and “Pinghong Nüshi” (“Rainbow Screen Lady Literata”). In the late eighteenth century, however, such a sensitive and elegant gesture would have been regarded as entirely inappropriate, given that these were the holiest of texts, the Confucian classics, and she a concubine. The most prominent exponent of this opposition was Lu Xuan’s wife Peng Zhenyin, as is audaciously recorded by Shen Cai herself in an epilogue after the final and fifty-eighth chapter “[Duke Mu of] Qin’s Vow,” having completed copying the entire book:\n [Shen] Cai, on receiving the order from her Master, proofread and edited Meanings in the Book of Documents. Yet one day, Lady Jade Inlay [Peng Zhenyin] voiced her thoughts, saying: ‘A woman’s role is to refine the five grains, cover [sieve] wines, and sew clothes, and that is all. Now, you have become something else; though it may be admirable, ultimately you have ruined your vocation. And apart from this, the incandescent brilliance of the Book of Documents—for this to emerge from the same hands that have touched the hairgrip, skirts, and hair oil, does this not besmirch them?’ [Shen] Cai, in response, informed her Master. The Master then called for his wife and addressed her, saying: ‘The Quacking Water Fowls is the essence of edification, and has its origins in the chamber; before Yao abdicated in favor of Shun, he first married off his daughters to him, and this tells of husbands and wives; of their abilities and roles. Of the heavenly spheres in their prescribed orbits, after the Purple Enclosure Wall, North Pole, and Emperor Star constellations, come the “Imperial Secretary (Shang Shu)” five stars, who govern the world under heaven, and when the Way is enlightened they look on, and when the Way is unenlightened they are dimmed. The Book of Documents (Shang Shu) is so titled. The sages took its meaning from this, and it was not that first there was the book and then the stars. Later, the appellation “Imperial Secretary” was used to mean “an official,” and this also happened later, with the so-named star always coming first. To the left of the “Imperial Secretary” star is the “Lady Literata” star. For this reason, the “new text” has twenty-eight chapters, and these also were transmitted by Fu Sheng’s daughter; were there no “new text,” there would be no means to investigate the old and new texts and their transmission. Currently, the task of editing and proofreading has been entrusted to Hongping, and this is also Heaven’s Way.’ His lady-wife then affirmed her assent, and thereafter ordered [Shen] Cai to record the matter at the end of the book.

The first two were repositories for Lu Xuan’s collection, and the third, the name for Shen Cai’s own literary studio. Subsequently, no other seals are found on any of the volumes until after the fall of the Qing dynasty, which likely means that the manuscript remained in the possession of Lu Xuan’s descendants until that time.\nOnce again, it is Liu Chenggan’s diary that is the source for new information as to the book’s location; his entry for the eleventh day of the eighth lunar month of 1916 includes information on a Shanghai book dealer Luo Zhenchang selling the manuscript and three other books to him for a price of 487 silver yuan.\nOther than Meanings in the Book of Documents, the only surviving specimens of Shen Cai’s handwritten manuscripts are two drafts of her opus Collection of the Spring Rain Pavilion, though these are much smaller in size and scope. They were also sold by Luo Zhenchang, this time to the collector and literatus Zheng Zhenduo in the 1940s. Zheng died in an airplane crash in the 1950s.

The latter then sold the most precious books to Zhu Shao, also known as Zhu Jiabin. As the current owner, Zhu Shao affixed his seals, and on the back page of the twelfth volume he also stuck in a piece of paper which includes his collector’s notes.\nDue to the runaway inflation of the time, the deal between Zhang Shuping and Zhu Shao quickly floundered; Zhang Shuping sought help from the Japanese occupying authorities, and Zhu Shao was thrown into prison. Eventually the book would find its way back to Zhang Shuping, whose subsequent seal is found in the second column from the right on the first page of the first juan of the first volume, directly above those of Liu Chenggan, and to the left of Zhu Shao’s.

The binding seems original and there is very little damage. Aside from a small water stain on the last pages of the volume, and slight discoloration along the top and bottom edges of the fascicle, there is no evidence of mold, foxing or insect damage.\nAll of the other fascicles have been repaired and rebound. Insect damage has been skillfully repaired and the original covers are encased in the betel nut tiger skin paper, either by wrapping the paper around the original fraying or worn blue silk covers, or by adding the new cover on top of the original silk.\nThe original labels were transferred to the new covers. During the repair process, the original endsheets were used to mend insect holes. This practice of taking blank pages from the original binding in order to repair damage to other areas of the text block was common practice. Also of interest is a handwritten note affixed to the last page of the last fascicle. The note was written by Zhu Shao (Jia Bin). From the pattern of insect damage and evidence of previously used sewing holes, it was discovered that this piece of paper was once bound as the front endsheet (huye) of the first fascicle. It could be that Zhu Shao removed this paper to write the note and had it bound into the back of the book when repaired. Another possibility is that Zhu Shao wrote the note while the page was still attached as the first endsheet of the first fascicle, and that it was later moved to the last fascicle by the next collector who may not have appreciated having the note from an earlier collector at the front of his book.\nWe may never know precisely when and why the page was relocated from the first to last fascicle, but it can be inferred that the restoration and rebinding period dates from the time that it was in the collection of Zhu Shao, or shortly after; and since it was not repaired after being acquired by the Fung Ping Shan Library,5 the repairs must have taken place between 1942 and 1949.\nThe book is in good condition. In general, the paper is still somewhat flexible and remains bright with little overall discoloration. There are water and mold stains in some volumes, and the previously repaired insect damage does not hinder the reading of the text. Only the upper left corners of the seventh to twelfth fascicles are worn away in an identical pattern, indicating that the damage occurred while they were stacked on top of each other. The original enclosure is unknown.\nAfter becoming a part of the Fung Ping Shan Library, two enclosures made of hard press board and a plastic impregnated cloth were made for the set. These materials, commonly used during the mid-20th century by Hong Kong binderies, are highly acidic. They not only change in color as they deteriorate, but they are also particularly ill-fitting.

Structural Notes: Commentary on the Book of Documents","type":"essay","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/shen-cai/5_structural_notes/"},{"content":"  劉承幹 Liu Chenggan   fullscreen   劉承幹 Liu Chenggan    Established in 1932, the Fung Ping Shan Library at The University of Hong Kong has collected more than 700 rare titles (11,000 volumes) dating back to the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. Many of these rare editions and manuscripts were acquired from the Jiaye Library (Jiayetang), a private collection located in Nanxun (now Huzhou, Zhejiang province) during China’s Republican period (1912–1949).\nAuthor’s manuscripts, especially those that predate the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), are now extremely rare. Manuscripts were generally disposed of after the books were published, as only the wooden blocks were kept for future printing. It was not until the late Ming that the importance of manuscripts was recognized; fewer than four thousand Ming and Qing author’s manuscripts survive.\nA manuscript is an original, handwritten copy of a work before it is printed—either a rough draft written by the author, a ‘fair copy’ transcribed by the author, or by someone else on the author’s behalf, or a copy edited and checked by the author and/or other scholars. A rough draft is usually written in a casual manner, reflecting the author’s reasoning and any alterations in the line of thought. A fair copy is the final, corrected copy based on the author’s rough draft.\nIn the early days, intellectuals transcribed for two main purposes: as a means to make a living and for academic pursuits. In addition, certain works, such as records of the daily lives of the imperial family, were never intended for circulation; only transcripts were kept. Voluminous works were costly to print, and in many cases transcription was the only viable way to make additional copies.\nBook collectors also transcribed rare editions to add to their own collections. This became common in the Ming dynasty, when Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1279–1368) editions were greatly sought after by book collectors. Individuals either would hire a scribe, or else transcribe the rare editions and add them to their personal collections.\nLiu Chenggan and the Jiaye Library\nLiu Chenggan (1882–1963) was a book collector who established the Jiaye Library in Nanxun in order to house his personal collection of 12,450 titles in 200,000 volumes. His collection included block prints from the Song (77 titles), Yuan (78 titles), Ming (more than 2,000 titles) and Qing (5,000 titles) dynasties, as well as 42 volumes of the Yongle Dadian (Yongle Encyclopaedia) and more than 1,200 local records. Equally impressive was the Jiaye Library’s collection of more than 2,000 manuscripts.\nIn the early 1950s, the Fung Ping Shan Library acquired a sizeable collection of rare books that formerly belonged to the Jiaye Library. The purchase included Song and Yuan block prints, along with a significant number of manuscripts.\nLiu Chenggan (1882–1963) was a native of Wuxing County (now Huzhou), Zhejiang province. As the adopted son of his father's older brother, he inherited a fortune from his grandfather, who was the richest man in Nanxun (now Huzhou). His father passed the imperial examination in 1894, and was awarded the jinshi, the highest degree. His father also collected numerous history books as part of a compilation of the administrative history of the late Qing period. Though he never took up any official position in the Qing government, he was awarded an honorary official title based on his contributions to relief work from 1909 to 1911. He pledged loyalty to Emperor Xuantong, the last Emperor of China, who presented him several plaques in thanks. Liu named his personal library Jiaye Tang and Xigu Lou by selecting inscriptions from the Emperor's plaques.\n  fullscreen         fullscreen   嘉業堂藏書印\nSeals of the Jiaye Library       fullscreen         Liu Chenggan once wrote that when the first national exposition of China was held in Nanjing in 1910, he took the opportunity to visit the book stalls and purchase countless books. News quickly spread amongst the booksellers who came to visit him with their books. It also should be noted that many book collectors sold their collections in response to the political upheavals associated with the downfall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. Such a historical background enabled Liu Chenggan to collect roughly 200,000 volumes from 1910 to 1924.\nLiu Chenggan was keen to build up a collection that was functional in nature. He paid special attention to the collection of manuscripts based on their uniqueness. And when he was unable to acquire an original title, he hired transcribers to make a copy so as to add it to his collection. He also was extremely generous in sharing his collection, so as to ensure that the rarest titles would last forever. In addition to setting aside a corner in his library for visitors to read and copy his books, he made them available to publishers for duplication free-of-charge. He even served as a printer and recruited a number of well-known scholars to edit and proofread rare titles in his collection before reprinting them.\nLocated in Nanxun, the Jiaye Library was completed in 1924. It occupied an area of twenty-four mu (1.6 hectares) and was staffed with personnel responsible for the management of the site and for publishing activities. The two-storey main building was designed with specific emphasis on proper ventilation and equipped with facilities to prevent fire, moisture and insects. In terms of facilities and design, the Jiaye Library resembled a modern library, despite the fact that it was constructed in a traditional manner.\n 原件藏浙江圖書館 Letter from Liu Chenggan to the Zhejiang Library, dated 19 November 1951\n(original in the Zhejiang Library)   fullscreen   原件藏浙江圖書館 Letter from Liu Chenggan to the Zhejiang Library, dated 19 November 1951\n(original in the Zhejiang Library)    The Library survived the Anti-Japanese War (1937–1945), but eventually Liu Chenggan ran out of money and had to sell part of the collection. He eventually donated the remaining library, including the building and its collection of books and wooden blocks, to the Zhejiang Library on 19 November 1951. The Zhejiang Library currently owns about half of the Jiaye Library Collection. Libraries like the National Library of China, Fudan University Library, Fung Ping Shan Library, The University of Hong Kong, Macao Central Library, Academia Sinica in Taiwan and the C.V. Starr East Asian Library of the University of California, Berkeley also hold some of the fine items from the collection.\nFung Ping Shan Library\nIn the early 1950s, the Fung Ping Shan Library acquired 120 titles (1,264 volumes) that had originally belonged to the Jiaye Library. These included block prints from the Song (2 titles), Yuan (13 titles), Ming (20 titles) and Qing (2 titles) dynasties, 4 Japanese block prints and 79 manuscript titles.\nMany book collectors were forced to sell their collections in order to survive during the war with Japan. Towards the end of 1940, Liu Chenggan also intended to sell part of his collection. He hoped to sell only the Song, Yuan and Ming block prints, and to keep the manuscripts and Qing editions. Things did not go according to plan, and eventually he was forced to sell a majority of his Song and Yuan block prints and manuscripts to Zhang Shuping (1898–1970).\nAround 1952, Chan Kwan-po (1898–1982), Librarian of the Fung Ping Shan Library from 1934 to 1953, learned from Wang Xiwen (1890–1960) that Liu Chenggan intended to sell the remainder of his rare books. Professor F.S. Drake (1892–1974) and Professor Jao Tsung-I of the School of Chinese strongly recommended that the University should acquire the collection. In mid-March 1953, the Fung Ping Shan Library did acquire most of the collection. The remaining titles were purchased by the Hong Kong-born Portuguese historian José Maria Braga (1897–1988). Braga resold his Jiayetang Collection in 1958 to the Sir Robert Ho Tung Library in Macao, except for five Siku Quanshu manuscripts, which he presented on behalf of the Portuguese Government, along with the six-volume Portugaliae monumenta cartographica, to The University of Hong Kong in November 1961. This marked the first time that Siku Quanshu manuscripts were resident in Hong Kong, and the Fung Ping Shan Library became the first Hong Kong institution to house these precious objects.\n","id":6,"length":1338,"title":"6.
